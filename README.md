# Employee Directory

## Overview

An employee directory created with React.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

A table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by each category

- Filter the users by each department.
